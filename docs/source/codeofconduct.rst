Code of Conduct
===============

The community of participants in einsteinpy is made up of members from around
the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is
through these differences that our community experiences success and continued
growth. We expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when
interacting with others both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is
to keep ours a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.

As members of the community,

* We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and
  bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or
  gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
  nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language and
  imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

* We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing
  acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge
  to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.

* We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and realize
  that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only
  serve to enrich our community. In particular, discussions relating to
  pros/cons of various technologies, programming languages, and so on are
  welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking proactive measure to
  ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can
  freely express their opinions.

* We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying
  particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to provide
  respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in discussion
  threads resulting from code contributions.

* We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community and
  to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that
  encourage productive debate and disagreement, both within our community and
  where we are criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the
  same respect as people within our community.

* We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to
  not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We will take 
  action when members of our community violate this code such as contacting 
  shreyas@einsteinpy.org (all emails sent to this address will be treated with 
  the strictest confidence) or talking privately with the person.
  
This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and offline,
including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences, meetings,
associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.

Parts of this code of conduct have been adapted from the Astropy code of
conduct.
